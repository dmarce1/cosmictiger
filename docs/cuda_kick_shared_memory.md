# Order-aware CUDA kick shared-memory policy

This document describes the runtime-selectable FMM order, the shared-memory
arena of the CUDA kick kernel, how its budget is chosen, and what was measured.
Sections marked *measured* report numbers from this workstation (RTX 3090,
compute capability 8.6, CUDA 12.8, GCC 13.3); everything else is design.

## FMM order

The FMM order equals the multipole degree p plus two: source multipoles carry
degree p, local expansions degree p + 1, and the Ewald derivative tensors ranks
0 through p + 1. Orders 3 through 9 are supported. Order 3 (dipoles with
quadratic expansions) is the smallest order whose local expansion can hold the
periodic uniform-background quadratic; a degree-1 expansion keeps only the
z-squared Laplacian slot of that term, so order 2 is not offered. Order 9
(degree-7 multipoles, degree-8 expansions) is the largest: the CUDA single
precision parity test showed order 10's host/device roundoff gap (6.9e-6)
approaching the 2e-5 budget, so single precision stops gaining there.

| order | multipole coefficients | positioned multipole bytes | local coefficients | local expansion bytes |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 3 | 4 | 28 | 10 | 40 |
| 4 | 9 | 48 | 17 | 68 |
| 5 | 16 | 76 | 26 | 104 |
| 6 | 25 | 112 | 37 | 148 |
| 7 | 36 | 156 | 50 | 200 |
| 8 | 49 | 208 | 65 | 260 |
| 9 | 64 | 268 | 82 | 328 |

Every order is compiled into the binary and the run selects one with
`gravity.fmmOrder` (default: the build's `COSMICTIGER_WITH_ORDER`, 7). The
order-dependent code is instantiated per order from templates:

- `cosmictiger/fmm_order.hpp`: constexpr coefficient counts, byte sizes, the
  `FmmOrder<order>` traits, the runtime `fmmOrder()` and `fmmDispatch()`, which
  switches to the matching instantiation at coarse boundaries (tree build, a
  CPU walk, a CUDA launch). Inner loops never test the order.
- `cosmictiger/fmm_types.hpp`: `FmmMultipole<Real, order>`,
  `FmmExpansion<Real, order>`, the position-first multipole record
  `FmmMultiPos<order>` (tree nodes point at its order-agnostic
  `MultipolePosition` header), and the max-size transport buffers
  `ExpansionBuffer` / `MultipoleBuffer` used by order-agnostic interfaces.
- `cosmictiger/fmm_kernels.hpp`: operator wrappers that deduce the degrees from
  their tensor arguments over the generated STF kernels.
- Generated code: `tools/generate_stf_m2l.py` emits one fully specialized
  kernel class per degree for local degrees 2 through 8 into a single header set
  in the build tree (`ninja cosmictiger_generated_kernels`), and
  `src/fmm_kernel_codegen.cpp` emits one Ewald derivative overload per order.
  Parsing the whole set costs about two seconds with g++ and three with nvcc.
- Per-order translation units: CMake configures
  `instances/fmm_instance_cpu_<order>.cpp` and `fmm_instance_cuda_<order>.cu`
  from `src/fmm_instance_*.in`; they explicitly instantiate the heavy CPU and
  CUDA templates so the orders compile in parallel.
- Ewald tables (`EwaldConst`) are filled once for the runtime order into
  buffers sized for order 9 (about 29 KB of constant memory).

## Bucket cap

`COSMICTIGER_WITH_MAX_BUCKET` (power of two, default 128) caps the runtime
`compute.bucketSize`. Leaves hold between half the runtime bucket plus one and
the runtime bucket particles. The kick arena is tuned for a runtime bucket
equal to the cap: its automatic sink-force tile covers the whole bucket
whenever the shared budget allows and only then falls back to bounded tiles.

## Shared-memory arena

One 32-thread warp per block. The dynamic shared memory of a block follows a
host-computed `CudaKickArenaLayout` (`cosmictiger/kick.hpp`):

Persistent region

- `CudaKickControl<order>`: the control objects of the interaction lists, the
  checklist stacks and the ancestor-expansion stack (their elements stay in the
  growable `cudaAllocate` pool), the staging barrier, and the resolved region
  pointers. 496 bytes at order 7.
- The active local expansion with its position (`compute.cudaKickSharedExpansion`,
  default on). Each node's L2L translates cooperatively into the arena scratch
  with `translateInto` (group leaders store their coefficients; no replicated
  per-lane result) and the warp copies the result back; ancestors awaiting their
  right child are pushed to and restored from global backing.

Reusable phase arena, sized for the largest simultaneously live set

- L2L output scratch (one expansion), used before any force exists.
- Sink-force planes gx, gy, gz, phi for `sinkCapacity` particles. They are
  initialized only after the cell interactions, so they alias the scratch.
- Source tiles following the force planes: particle planes x, y, z (and a mass
  plane only for mixed-mass runs; equal-mass runs instantiate PP/CP without it)
  or staged positioned multipoles with a 16-byte stride. The two tiles overlap,
  because PC and PP never run concurrently. PC accumulates all staged
  multipoles in registers and writes each sink once.

Lifetimes: staged tiles are refilled only after every lane has finished reading
them (`__syncwarp()` after each use); the checklist copy and CP share one
barrier, so the copy completes before CP starts; the control block is
constructed by every lane and lane zero writes the resolved pointers only after
a warp barrier. compute-sanitizer racecheck reports no hazards and no warnings
for the fmmWalk regression; memcheck is clean. synccheck reports 32 "missing
init/wait" diagnostics on the `cuda::barrier` objects in dynamic shared memory;
the unchanged baseline kernel reports the same 32, so these are a pre-existing
tool interaction, not a new hazard.

Forces for buckets larger than the sink tile are processed as consecutive
sink tiles: forces are zeroed, PC and PP run over the full interaction lists,
and the kick of that tile follows, so lists are built once per leaf and sources
are re-staged per tile. `compute.cudaKickSinkTile=-1` keeps whole-bucket forces
in global backing instead.

## Budget and tile selection

`kickArenaLayoutImpl<order>()` reads the compiled kernel's registers and static
shared memory with `cudaFuncGetAttributes` and the device limits (shared memory
per SM, the 1 KB driver reservation per block, registers per SM, blocks and
warps per SM). The register-limited residency uses the 256-register warp
allocation granularity. For the requested residency (`compute.cudaKickResidency`,
default: the register limit) the byte budget per block is the per-SM shared
memory divided by the residency, minus the reservation and static shared
memory, rounded down to the 128-byte allocation unit. The layout is then built
to fit that budget (defaults: whole-bucket sink tile, 512 staged particles, a
multipole tile that fills the remaining source bytes up to 64 records, trimmed
particles-first when the budget is exceeded) and verified with
`cudaOccupancyMaxActiveBlocksPerMultiprocessor`; the budget shrinks by one
allocation unit until the calculator agrees. The chosen policy is printed once
per order as `CUDA kick arena (FMM order N): ...`.

Options (all default to automatic): `compute.cudaKickResidency`,
`compute.cudaKickSinkTile`, `compute.cudaKickParticleTile`,
`compute.cudaKickMultipoleTile`, `compute.cudaKickSharedExpansion`,
`compute.cudaKickHandoffBlocks` (pins the CPU/GPU handoff divisor so allocation
variants can be compared at identical work division).
